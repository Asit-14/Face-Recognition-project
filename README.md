#Face recognition 

This repository contains a Python script for face recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. The script captures real-time video from a camera, detects faces in the stream, and compares them with previously loaded images to identify known faces.

Features:

Dynamic Loading: Quickly load multiple facial images for identification.
Real-time Face Recognition: Identify faces in live video feeds.
Multiple Person Support: Identify and distinguish between multiple people.
Conditions:

Face recognition in OpenCV Application: Install the necessary libraries using pip install opencv-python face_recognition.
In the script, provide the paths to each person's picture files and corresponding names.
Execute the script: python Face-detect-vdo.py. Press 'q' to end the video broadcast.
Contributions:

Configuration: To improve recognition accuracy, tweak the tolerance option in compare_faces.
Contributing: We appreciate your contributions! Please open pull requests and issues.
